# Yewscion Scripts

`Yewscion Scripts` is a collection of utility scripts I maintain for
my own personal use, in a [literate programming][litr] file.

[litr]: http://www.literateprogramming.com/

## Installation

For now, installation is manual.

All generated files are in the `exports/` directory, under their
types.

Copy `exports/bin/*` somewhere in Your `$PATH`.

Copy `exports/man/*` somewhere in Your `$MANPATH` and run `mandb`.

Copy `exports/texi/*` somewhere in Your `$INFOPATH` and run `install-info`.

## Usage

See relevant documentation. Current scripts include:

- **adlmidi-wrapper**: *Let's EMMS and ADLMidi play well together.*
